# ClimbPop

Due to Coronavirus safety measures, access to climbing gyms is limited.
This small python program gathers from Arkose Websites the current capacity of the gyms. This info is available on their websites :

- [Arkose Montreuil](https://montreuil.arkose.com/)
- [Arkose Nation](https://nation.arkose.com/)
- [Arkose Massy](https://massy.arkose.com/)

I used the requests module as well as BeautifulSoup.

## Update : 03/07/2020

Arkose Massy removed it’s counter because there never was a real need for it, the gym is never full (it’s so huge lol).
